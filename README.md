- Iâ€™m a student learning to build websites. Iâ€™m good at using HTML and CSS, which are the building blocks of web pages, and Iâ€™m getting better at JavaScript, which makes websites interactive. Iâ€™m also learning how to use Vue.js, a tool that helps make websites more dynamic.
* Right now, Iâ€™m studying computer science and working on small web projects to practice what Iâ€™ve learned. My goal is to become a professional front-end developer who can create great-looking and easy-to-use websites.
+ Iâ€™m putting together a collection of my work to show what I can do. Itâ€™s a work in progress.
